Kaseya Ransomware attack - July 2 July 16th - 2021:

Kaseya is a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform. It is used by MSPs, for remote monitoring and managment. It is mainly used for Endpoint security.

The attack affected over 50 MSPs that use Kaseya. Each MSP supported companies. The total companies affected ranged between 800 and 1500 respectively. However, this was only 0.001% of Kaseya's total consumer base.

REvil, the ransomware-as-a-service supplier, was resposnsible for the attack. They sold a Zero-Day exploit that was used in the attack.

Kaseya has done nothing as far as I am aware to prevent this from happening in the future, aside from patching the then-Zero-Day exploit. Zero-days are unknown threats, so, they can not fix software vulnerabilities they do not know about.
